## Pearls of Water Droplet

Picture taken at Kyoto University on March 26th, 2022.
It was a day when a light rain, almost like a drizzle, was falling continuously.
On my way back home after finishing my research, I saw a tree illuminated by a street lamp, and the dew on its branches was sparkling like the decorations of a Christmas tree.
