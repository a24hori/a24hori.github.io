# Conference at my alma mater

From September 9th to 11th, 2024, a conference of the Operations Research Society of Japan in the fall was held at Nanzan University, where I received a bachelor's and a master's degree.
When I was a student at Nanzan University, it had two campuses: Nagoya and Seto.
The Seto campus was far from the center of Nagoya, and the Faculty of Science and Engineering, to which I belonged, was in Seto.
I used to commute by public transportation for around two hours to get there.

Now, Nanzan University has unified into one campus in Nagoya, and all faculties are there.
Every part of the landscape reminded me of my memories from when I was a student at Nanzan University.
I am very glad to have attended the conference in person and to have met professors at Nanzan.
