## Pearls of Water

Picture taken at Kyoto University on March 26th, 2022.
It was a day when a light rain, almost like a drizzle, was falling continuously.
On my way back home after finishing my research, I saw a tree illuminated by a street lamp, and the dew on its branches was sparkling like the decorations of a Christmas tree.

I named this sight "Pearls of Water".
Initially, I thought of calling it "Water Droplet Decorations," but the name had poor phonetics, and water and electricity don't go well together.
Therefore, I decided to compare the pearls that water droplets can create naturally to the sight before me and named it "Pearls of Water."
