			<h1>Conference at my alma mater</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>From September 9th to 11th, 2024, a conference of the Operations Research Society of Japan in the fall was held at Nanzan University, where I received a bachelor’s and a master’s degree. When I was a student at Nanzan University, it had two campuses: Nagoya and Seto. The Seto campus was far from the center of Nagoya, and the Faculty of Science and Engineering, to which I belonged, was in Seto. I used to commute by public transportation for around two hours to get there.</p>
			<p> Now, Nanzan University has unified into one campus in Nagoya, and all faculties are there. Every part of the landscape reminded me of my memories from when I was a student at Nanzan University. I am very glad to have attended the conference in person and to have met professors at Nanzan.</p>
